# NYC-Taxi-Trip-Prediction

# Abstract

A typical taxi company faces a common problem of efficiently assigning the cabs to passengers so that the service is smooth and hassle free. One of main issue is determining the duration of the current trip so it can predict when the cab will be free for the next trip.
For this ML Project, I have used NYC Taxi Dataset.
The primary dataset is one released by the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission, which includes pickup time, geo-coordinates, number of passengers and several other variables. The dataset is based on the 2016 NYC yellow cab trip record data.
We will use different EDA concepts using Python and their packages, Matplotlib and seaborn to come up with various graphs and charts by using the dataset and get some insights of data which will help us in modelling. We will use different regression methods to develop a model and see how our model behaves.

# Problem statement

Our task is to build a model that predicts the total ride duration of taxi trips in New York City. Based on
the individual trip attributes, we should predict the duration of each trip in the test set.
